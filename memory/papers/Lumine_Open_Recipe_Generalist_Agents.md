## Abstract
Lumine, a vision-language model-based agent, completes complex missions in real-time across different 3D open-world environments with human-like efficiency and zero-shot cross-game generalization.

## Key Contributions
- First open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real-time within challenging 3D open-world environments
- Human-like interaction paradigm unifying perception, reasoning, and action in end-to-end manner
- Powered by a vision-language model that processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions
- Trained in Genshin Impact, successfully completes entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline
- Strong zero-shot cross-game generalization capabilities
