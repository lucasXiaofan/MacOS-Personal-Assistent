## Abstract
A multi-agent framework refines conversational responses by addressing factuality, personalization, and coherence, outperforming single-agent methods on challenging datasets. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in conversational systems by generating human-like responses. However, they can fall short, especially when required to account for personalization or specific knowledge. In real-life settings, it is impractical to rely on users to detect these errors and request a new response. The work proposes refining responses through a multi-agent framework that adaptively selects and coordinates the most relevant agents based on the specific requirements of each query.
